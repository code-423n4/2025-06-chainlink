### ❗️ Notes for auditors
1. **PoC required:** High- and Medium-risk submissions require a [coded, runnable Proof of Concept](https://docs.code4rena.com/competitions/submission-guidelines#required-proof-of-concept-poc-for-solidity-evm-audits).
1. **All submissions will be kept private:** The findings and report from this audit will remain private to the Chainlink team; the report will not be published publicly. [Wardens with the SR role](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/sr-wardens) will be able to view submissions and participate in post-judging QA as usual, but all finding details, judge decisions, etc. will remain confidential. 
1. **Judging phase risk adjustments:**
    - High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA) will be ineligible for awards.
    - Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.
    - As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

## Automated findings / publicly known issues

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-06-chainlink/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).

_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

 - one claim contract per token. If a project redeploys token/has multiple tokens, new claim contracts should be deployed 
 - merkle proofs are only accessible through FE after user/delegate goes through the validations 
 (Terms of Service signing, wallet sanction & delegation checks, ..) 
 - zero adminRoleTransferDelay for the factory contract 
 - non-standard tokens or malicious build projects 
 - all role granted addresses should be assumed to be non-malicious 
 - someone makes a claim on behalf of another by reusing their regular claim merkle proofs

# Overview

[Chainlink Rewards (CLR)](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-build-program/) is a community engagement and rewards program designed to incentivize active participation in the Chainlink Network. The contracts in this document are designed to allow projects in the [Chainlink Build program](https://chain.link/economics/build-program) (CLR projects) to deploy an on-chain claim mechanism of their tokens for Chainlink ecosystem participants.

## Scoping Q&A

| Question | Answer |
| ---------------| ------------- |
| ERC20 used by the protocol |  |

### EIP compliance checklist 
 - The project tokens that interact with BUILDClaim should comply with EIP-20 
 - BUILDClaim: EIP-165

# Additional context

## Areas of concern (where to focus for bugs)
 The team's largest concerns with the Chainlink Rewards S1 protocol are around: 
 -   Integrity of the allocation and claim mechanism( ie can members successfully allocate 
 their cubes and then claim their reward tokens?) 
 -   Can projects successfully deploy their build claim contract? 
 -   Does a rewards member earn the correct amount of rewards at all times? 
 -   Are any rewards locked into contracts? 
 -   Does multi season claiming work correctly? 
 -   Does early vesting work correctly, in particular a staker cannot have their tokens early 
 vested by another party? 
 -   Does delegation work correctly? 

 Access controls: 
 -   Are all access control modifiers implemented correctly and working as expected? 
 -   Can addresses other than the admin access admin only functions? This includes 
 setting configuration, adding projects, removing projects, deploying claims 
 -   Can addresses other than the pauser pause or unpause the contract. 
 -   Can addresses other than a claimant claim rewards, particularly early vest which causes 
 forfeiting of rewards. 
 -   If a project goes rogue, does the access control limit the damage it can be done by the

## Main invariants

- More than the max token amount cannot be claimed 
- The claimable and refundable amount never exceeds the token balance. 
- The factory’s maxAvailableAmount never exceeds the token balance. 
- There are secondary variants: 
  - total refunded never exceeds the total allocated 
  - total withdrawn never exceeds the total deposited 
  - total withdrawn never exceeds the max possible withdrawn amount 
  - total deposited and refunded amount always equals exceeds total allocated and 
  withdrawn amount 
  - total refunded amount never exceeds total allocated to all seasons 
  - total withdrawn amount never exceeds total deposited amount 
  - total withdrawn amount never exceeds max possible withdrawable amount 
  - total deposited and refunded amount always equals or exceeds total allocated 
  and withdrawn amount 

## All trusted roles in the protocol

| Role                                | Description                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Factory admin                       |                 |
| Project admin                       |                 |
| Pauser                              |                 |
| Claimant                            |                 |

## Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts:
Users can one time only “early vest” and receive a portion of their unvested tokens. They receive an amount that is proportional to the time remaining in a linear increasing band, i.e.
